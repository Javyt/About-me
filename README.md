<p style="text-align:center;">"Heh… so you've come, ignorant fool. You dared to venture into the abyss, seeking knowledge beyond mortal comprehension. But be warned! The more you learn about me, the deeper you’ll be entangled in the web of fate! _The Organization_ may already be watching."</p>

**"I am Javier Bañuelos, an entity beyond time and space! …Or, if you must conform to society’s constraints, you may refer to me as a _3D Generalist_. My experiments in the realm of the third dimension have been ongoing for three years, yet my ultimate world-dominating masterpiece is still in the works. When it is complete… humanity will never be the same again!"**

**"But wait—there’s more! My dominion extends beyond the realm of 3D! I wield the forbidden arts of video sorcery and image manipulation! For almost a decade, I have refined my craft, bending pixels to my will, defying reality itself! Tremble, mere mortals, for my skills are unparalleled!"**
