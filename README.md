# About-me
[<img=
Hmm? Want to gossip my profile? I see... Well, I guess I have no choice. But beware: the moment you discover about me, the more in danger you will be.
I'm a 3D Generalist currently in learning proccess. I have been 3 years into this field, and soon I will be the best, I will create the most shocking projects ever!
Nevertheless, my knowledge covers even more! Though 3D is my main passion, video and image editing is as well! Tremble, you mortals, it's been almost ten years!
